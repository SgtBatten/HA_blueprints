## Frigate Notifications

This blueprint will send a notification to your device when a Frigate event for the selected camera is fired. The notification will initially include the thumbnail of the detection, but include an actionable notification allowing you to view the clip and snapshot.

With this blueprint, you may send the notification to multiple devices by leaving "Device" blank and instead use a [notification group][1].
