    ## Frigate Notifications

    This blueprint will send a notification to your device when a Frigate event for the selected camera is fired. The notification will initially include the thumbnail of the detection, but include an actionable notification allowing you to view the clip and snapshot.

    With this blueprint, you may send the notification to multiple devices by leaving "Device" blank and instead use a [notification group][1].

    ### Software Version Requirements
      - Minimum Home Assistant Version: 2022.2
      - Minimum Frigate Version: 0.11.0
      - Minimum Frigate Integration Version: 3.0.0
        - **Note:** “Enable the unauthenticated notification event proxy” must be ticked during setup
      - An MQTT broker connected to home assistant and frigate.
      - Minimum iOS Version: 15.0

    ### Required entities:
      - Frigate Camera Name
      - Mobile App Device **or** the name of a Notification Group or TV

    ### Features:
      - Easily select the camera entity or mobile device using a drop down menu.
      - Send notifications to an Android or IOS mobile device or a TV.
        - or a group containing any combination of the above.
      - Configure the title and message of the notification. 
      - Dynamically handle things like object type, zones and face detection from doubletake.
      - Automatically handle some common errors like case matching and bad urls etc.
      - Optionally send the notification as a critical alert. (Critical)
      - Optionally limit the playing of audio for secondary notification updates, and on IOS, customise the sound. (Alert Once)
      - Choose whether or not to update the notification with new thumbnails as they become available.
      - Customise the notification colour and icon.
      - Optionally send a live view to IOS.
      - Configure custom notification channels on Android.
      - Specify which [zones][2] to be notified about. (Zone Filter)
      - Specify what type of [objects][3] to be notified about. (Object Filter)
      - Disable notifications if a presence entity or group is "home". (Presence Filter)
      - Limit notifications based on the state of another entity. (State Filter)
      - Limit notifications to certain hours of the day. (Time Filter)
      - Configure a cooldown for the camera to reduce the number of notifications when back-to-back events occur.
      - Silence future notifications for a defined amount of time through actionable notifications. This is helpful in situations where you know you will be triggering detections for an extended period of time. i.e. kids playing outside.
      - Set a loitering timer to notify you of stationary objects that remain for a set period of time.
      - Configure what happens when you tap the notification (Tap Action)
      - Configure 3 action buttons to open almost anything (defaults are: View Clip, View Snapshot and Silence New Notifications)
      - Configure the size, transparency, position and duration of TV notifications.
      - Debug option to help troubleshooting

    ### Beta Changes:
      - Support for multiple Frigate instances by specifying the ClientID and MQTT topic
      - Android option: Sticky as per https://community.home-assistant.io/t/frigate-mobile-app-notifications/311091/1043
      - Add 10s delay to final notification update to ensure frigate has time to save snapshot edits (crop, bounding box etc) if update thumbnail is enabled. 
      - Add Video (gif) option to Android which will be sent 10 seconds after the event ends.
      - Optional delay to the initial notification to see if it resolves the no attached image issue.
